What’s the best way to communicate with me?
You can always slack me if you need anything, I frecuently check my notifications there, if you want to send me an email, slack me so i can check it sooner!

If I don’t respond, try:
Waiting :)

How do I like to give feedback? I will always try to give constructive feedback if i see something that needs it, i can always be wrong, so please correct me if i am.
Prob slack/email is the best (and only way). Frecuency? when needed

How do I like to receive feedback? I love receiving feedback! I can always do things better, so you can always slack/email/zoom me if i can improve on anything!
